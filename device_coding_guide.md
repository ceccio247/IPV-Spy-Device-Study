## Coding Guide
What follows is a small guide we used to code the spy devices we got from our crawl. Note that it is not comprehensive, as we performed collaborative coding as discussed in the paper.

### Primary vs secondary use case
Primary use case can be unclear, secondary can be concatenated list of use cases.

### Definitions for “hidden” or “hideable”:
1. A device is “intended to be hidden” if the description mentions hiding the device.
2. A device is “hideable” if it is small (ex: fits in the palm of your hand/is less than 4cm to a side).
3. Things that must be out in the open cannot be hidden (ex: solar powered GPS trackers).
4. Non-mesh bluetooth trackers are irrelevant.

GPS trackers that are meant to track fleets and children are intended to be hidden.
GPS trackers that are meant for tracking only pets are not intended to be hidden.
Devices that mention the word ‘spy’ are intended to be hidden.

Nanny cam in the title doesn’t necessarily mean its meant for spying on nannies, its just a commonly used keyword for ‘hidden camera’.

OBD2 port trackers are ‘can be hidden’.
