# Snowball Results

This directory contains the code for running the snowball search as well as code for filtering the results. In the filtering code (`good_bad_list.py`), some of the terms are commented out. Those were commented out when switching from searching for devices to searching for detectors.

In the `devices` and `detectors` directories, there are the final lists of queries the snowball searches returned. We also include lists of the queries we filtered out of the snowball search.
